                        Dating apps offer a new way to connect with people but currently the replies sometimes are so slow. In theory dating apps are great but they don&apos;t work well in practice. People take too long to reply, we judge people by the picture and it&apos;s not a true connection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WeVibe allows you to connect with someone who meets your criteria, speak to them for 4 mins and if you connect you can continue the conversation. It&apos;s really about the human connection.
